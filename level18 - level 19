OverTheWire Bandit – Level 18 → Level 19

 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` in the home directory.  
However, the `.bashrc` file has been modified to immediately log you out when you try to connect using SSH.

 Commands Used
- ssh
- ls
- cat

 Steps
1. Connect to `bandit18` while bypassing the interactive shell:
   ssh bandit18@localhost -p 2220 bash
2.List files in the home directory:
ls
3.Read the readme file:
cat readme
4.Note down the displayed password.
5.Use this password to log in as bandit19.

Result
Successfully retrieved the password for bandit19 by bypassing the forced logout behavior.
