OverTheWire Bandit – Level 20 → Level 21

Level Goal
A **setuid binary** is provided in the home directory.  
It connects to `localhost` on a port you specify, reads a line of input, and compares it with the password from the previous level (`bandit20`).  
If the password is correct, it returns the password for the next level (`bandit21`).

 Commands Used
- ssh
- nc
- cat
- bash

Steps
1. Login as `bandit20` using SSH.
2. Read the current level password:
  cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
3.Start a listener on a local port (example: 1234):
nc -l 1234
4.In another terminal (or background process), execute the setuid binary and connect it to the same port:
./suconnect 1234
5.Paste the bandit20 password into the netcat listener and press Enter.
6.The binary verifies the password and sends back the password for the next level.

Result
Successfully retrieved the password for bandit21 using inter-process communication.

What I Learned
Understanding how setuid binaries interact with network services
Using netcat for local communication
Managing multiple terminal sessions and background processes
Practical client–server interaction concepts
