OverTheWire Bandit – Level 13 → Level 14

 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user `bandit14`.

 Commands Used
- ssh
- cat
- chmod

 Steps
1. Login as `bandit13` using SSH.
2. List files to find the private SSH key:
   ls
3.View the SSH private key:
  cat sshkey.private
4.Set correct permissions for the key:
  chmod 600 sshkey.private
5.Login to the next level using the SSH key:
  ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
6.Read the password file:
  cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

Result
Password for bandit14 obtained successfully.
