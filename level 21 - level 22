OverTheWire Bandit – Level 21 → Level 22

Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals using **cron** (the Linux job scheduler).  
The task is to inspect the cron configuration in `/etc/cron.d/` and find the command that reveals the password for the next level.

Commands Used
- ls
- cat
- cron

Steps
1. Login as `bandit21` using SSH.
2. List the cron configuration files:
   ls /etc/cron.d/
3.View the Bandit cron job file:
 cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
4.Observe the command executed by cron (usually a script).
5.Read the script being executed:
  cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
6.Identify where the script stores or outputs the password.
7.Read the password file shown in the script:
 cat /tmp/<filename>

Result
Password for bandit22 obtained successfully from the cron job execution.
