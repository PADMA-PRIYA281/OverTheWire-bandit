OverTheWire Bandit – Level 22 → Level 23

 Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals using **cron**.  
The cron configuration is located in `/etc/cron.d/`.  
The task is to analyze the script being executed and determine how it generates the password for the next level.

 Commands Used
- ls
- cat
- bash

Steps
1. Login as `bandit22` using SSH.
2. List cron configuration files:
   ls /etc/cron.d/
3.View the cron job related to bandit23:
  cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
4.Identify the script being executed and open it:
  cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
5.Analyze the script logic to understand how the password file name is generated.
6.Use the same logic manually to locate the password file in /tmp.
7.Read the generated password file:
  cat /tmp/<generated_filename>

Result
Password for bandit23 obtained successfully by analyzing a cron-executed script.
