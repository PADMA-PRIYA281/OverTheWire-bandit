OverTheWire Bandit – Level 16 → Level 17

 Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a service running on **localhost** between ports **31000–32000**.  
Only one of these services uses **SSL/TLS** and provides the correct credentials.

 Commands Used
- ssh
- nmap
- openssl
- s_client

 Steps
1. Login as `bandit16` using SSH.
2. Scan ports between 31000 and 32000 to find open ports:
   nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
3.Identify which open port uses SSL/TLS.

4.Connect to the SSL-enabled port using OpenSSL:
 openssl s_client -connect localhost:<port>
5.Paste the current level password and press Enter.
6.The server returns the private SSH key for the next level.
7.Save the key to a file (example: bandit17.key).
8.Set correct permissions:
  chmod 600 bandit17.key
9.Login to the next level using the SSH key:
  ssh -i bandit17.key bandit17@localhost -p 2220
Result
Successfully logged in as bandit17 using the retrieved SSH private key.
