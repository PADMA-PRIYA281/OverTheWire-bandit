OverTheWire Bandit – Level 2 → Level 3

## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `spaces in this filename` located in the home directory.

## Commands Used
- ls
- cat

## Steps
1. Login to the server as `bandit2` using SSH.
2. List the files in the home directory:
   ```bash
   ls
Since the filename contains spaces, read it using quotes:

bash
Copy code
cat "spaces in this filename"
Note down the password displayed.

Result
Password for bandit3 obtained successfully.

What I Learned
Handling filenames with spaces

Using quotes in Linux commands

Better command-line file handling
