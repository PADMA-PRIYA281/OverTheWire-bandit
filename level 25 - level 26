OverTheWire Bandit – Level 25 → Level 26 Walkthrough

Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy...
The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else.
Your task is to find out:
What shell bandit26 uses,
How it works,
And how to break out of it to get the password for bandit26.

Commands You May Need
ssh
cat
more
vi
ls
id
pwd

Step-by-Step Solution
Login as bandit25 using SSH.
Connect to bandit26 via SSH:
 ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Notice that the shell is not the usual bash shell. To find out which shell is used, try:
echo $0 
or
ps -p $$
Explore how the shell behaves; it is likely a restricted shell or some custom environment that limits commands.
To break out of this restricted shell, try launching a fully functional shell by running:
  /bin/sh
or
  /bin/bash
Once you break out to a normal shell, you can navigate the filesystem:
 ls
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
to get the password for bandit26.

Result
Successfully escaped the restricted shell environment to retrieve the password for bandit26.
